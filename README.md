# Sales Performance, Profitability & Delivery Analysis (Excel Dashboard)

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes transactional sales data to uncover insights related to revenue performance, customer behavior, product profitability, and delivery efficiency. Using Microsoft Excel, raw sales records were transformed into a structured analytical model and an interactive dashboard designed to support data‑driven business decisions.

The final dashboard provides a consolidated view of key performance indicators (KPIs), regional trends, category and customer contributions, and delivery metrics, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify opportunities, risks, and areas for improvement.
